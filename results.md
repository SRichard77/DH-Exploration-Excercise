#### DH Exploration Exercise

For the DH Exploration Exercise, I chose to explore the 86 page diary of Abbie Bright of which she wrote in from September 1870 to June 1871, that I found [here](https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223662). I used Wget to pull the pages of the diary onto my Mac, and I read through some of the pages. It was a little difficult to read the actual writing of Abbie Bright, so I began reading through the [text version](https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223662/text). It was interesting to read some of Abbie's diary entries and learn more about her life as well as society at the time of her writing. Prior to this, I had no idea who Abbie was or why her diaries are being preserved and digitized by Kansas Memory. My choice of using Abbie's diaries was slightly random, however I knew I wanted to explore a diary of a woman from the past. As Sharon Leon explains in her article, "Returning Women to the History of Digital History," the Great Man Narrative is strongly present in Digital History, with women and their digitial history projects being left out [^1]. I bring this up as it reminds me of how in history in general, the stories of women and other marginalized groups are also often left out or silenced. Thinking back to the [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/amaliasl/status/1245544256212807680) about archival silences, and certain things being left out of digitized archives, it makes me wonder why and how Abbie's diary was chosen to be preserved and accessible online. Perhaps this is because Abbie was privileged by being a middle-upper class white woman, as I have learned throughout this course and other courses how things such as gender, race, class, etc., can influence what an archive holds and/or makes available to people online. 

#### Findings from Voyant

I decided to use Voyant to get a distant read of Abbie Bright's diary, with macroscopic perspectives. The first interesting thing I noticed when using Voyant was the links between certain words. It can be found [here](https://voyant-tools.org/tool/CollocatesGraph/?query=went&query=home&query=came&mode=corpus&corpus=8a6baf4ebe3eb98694b547f3ed4eee68). The words home, went, and came were all linked. This was intersting as Abbie travelled while writing in her diary, so the links between these words make sense. Another interesting link between the words is Phillip and home. Phillip is said to be Abbie's brother, and so the link between Phillip and home also made sense as she connects her brother to her home. 

I examined the Cirrus made from Voyant, which can be found [here](https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Cirrus/?visible=25&corpus=8a6baf4ebe3eb98694b547f3ed4eee68). It was interesting to see that among the most used words was the word "page." In the text version, the pages were listed before the diary entry for each page. I will attach a screenshot here for example:

Due to this, I believe the word 'page' came up as one most frequently used, however it was not one of the words used by Abbie herself, rather the person who transcribed the document to allow it to have a text version. In the two readings from Part Two on the Bentham Project, it was explained how they use volunteers to transcribe the Bentham documents and make them readily available as sources online [^2]. I wanted to know if the Kansas Memory by the Kansas Historical Society also relied on volunteers for the transcription of their archival materials. I did some searching around on the Website, and found [this](https://www.kansasmemory.org/faq#) page, of which answered my question. They also rely on volunteers to transcribe their materials. Within that link, there is also instructions on how to become a volunteer to transcribe the materials. 

Another interesting thing I found from the Cirrus I linked above with the most used words, was the words "brother" and "mr." Immediately I connected this to how women in the past were seen as inferior to men in society, and it was not overly surprising to see words reflecting masculinity to be of the most used words in the diary. I found this [webpage](https://www.kshs.org/p/the-diary-of-abbie-bright-1870-1871-1/13214) on the Kansas Historical Society site and it explained how since it was not part of the "norm" for a young woman to be travelling alone in society in that time period, she often visited her brother and other family members in order to keep her from being seen as perhaps unmoral in society, as well as for her to be able to continue on her adventures of travelling [^3]. 

#### Point Map with Google My Maps

While reading through Abbie Bright's diary, I noticed many locations that she mentions she visited and or travelled to. Immediately, I thought to myself that I can make a map with these locations. I used what I learned in this course, by making a spreadsheet and importing it into the map to make this map, which I discuss in my log.md file. I did not use every single location mentioned in Abbie's diary, as a few of them no longer exist today, or they just have different names, and I was unable to find the exact location of where it would be. Therefore, I only chose the locations of cities that she mentions to ensure accuracy in my map. The map that I made can be found [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1_SYKyFZMcbMMYRjOVaOdspJu8hOp7x4&usp=sharing).

#### Further research that could be done with this data

I believe that there is a lot of things that can be done with this data, and many arguments that can be made. Throughout this course I have learned many different ways digital history can argue. With the data from Abbie Bright's diary, I believe an analysis can be done on her gender, race and class. While she was obviously from a privileged background, I wonder what else can be explored to further expand on this. Perhaps, maybe in comparison to a diary of someone from a marginalized group, as I am sure their diary entries would be quite different. While Abbie was able to travel and hide the fact she was a lone young woman by visiting family along her journey, I question would this be possible for a woman from a marginalized group in society? With Abbie Bright's diary, there are plenty of questions and analysis' that can emerge from it.
