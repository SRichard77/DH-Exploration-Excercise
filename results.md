#### DH Exploration Exercise

For the DH Exploration Exercise, I chose to explore the 86 page diary of Abbie Bright of which she wrote in from September 1870 to June 1871, that I found [here](https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223662). I used Wget to pull the pages of the diary onto my Mac, and I read through some of the pages. It was a little difficult to read the actual writing of Abbie Bright, so I began reading through the [text version](https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223662/text). It was interesting to read some of Abbie's diary entries and learn more about her life as well as society at the time of her writing. Prior to this, I had no idea who Abbie was or why her diaries are being preserved and digitized by Kansas Memory. My choice of using Abbie's diaries was slightly random, however I knew I wanted to explore a diary of a woman from the past. As Sharon Leon explains in her article, "Returning Women to the History of Digital History," the Great Man Narrative is strongly present in Digital History, with women and their digitial history projects being left out [^1]. I bring this up as it reminds me of how in history in general, the stories of women and other marginalized groups are also often left out or silenced. Thinking back to the [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/amaliasl/status/1245544256212807680) about archival silences, and certain things being left out of digitized archives, it makes me wonder why and how Abbie's diary was chosen to be preserved and accessible online. Perhaps this is because Abbie was privileged by being a middle-upper class white woman, as I have learned throughout this course how things such as gender, race, class, etc., can influence what an archive holds and/or makes available to people online. 

#### Findings from Voyant

I decided to use Voyant to get a distant read of Abbie Bright's diary, with macroscopic perspectives. 


#### Google Maps

I noticed there was many locations written that Abbie passed by or visited, so I decided to make a Google Maps, like I learned more about in Part Three of this course, to map down some the locations Abbie visited.
